The Monitor module contains the Monitor class, the Activity class,
and a collection of constants. Together the elements of the module
help keep a record of activities that have occurred.

Activities fall into two categories: Rider activities and Driver
activities. Each activity also has a description, which is one of
request, cancel, pickup, or dropoff.

=== Constants ===
@type RIDER: str
    A constant used for the Rider activity category.
@type DRIVER: str
    A constant used for the Driver activity category.
@type REQUEST: str
    A constant used for the request activity description.
@type CANCEL: str
    A constant used for the cancel activity description.
@type PICKUP: str
    A constant used for the pickup activity description.
@type DROPOFF: str
    A constant used for the dropoff activity description.
